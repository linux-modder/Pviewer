Pviewer
=======

This is an experimental image viewer. Its in an early state. English is not my first language but I try to make english comments in the code.

To view a picture:
  python Pviewer /path/to/image.img
  or
  python Pviewer ()
  and drag and drop a file to the window
  
to manipulate the image:
  click on the picture ,hold, and move the cursor for translation
  rigth click,hold and move the cursor around the circule for rotation
  move the wheel over the pic to change its scale
  move the mouse over the rigth edge to see the toolbar
  the keyboard shortcurs are "1 2 4 5 6 8 / * - +  rePag. avPag." keys
